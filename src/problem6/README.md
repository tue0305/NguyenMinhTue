# Live Leaderboard API Module Specification

## Overview

This document specifies a backend module for managing a real-time leaderboard system. The module allows users to perform actions that increase their scores and provides a live-updating scoreboard showing the top 10 users.

## System Requirements

1. Maintain a scoreboard displaying the top 10 users by score
2. Provide real-time updates to the scoreboard when scores change
3. Process score updates from authenticated user actions
4. Prevent unauthorized score manipulation
5. Scale to handle high volumes of concurrent score updates

## Architecture

The Live Leaderboard module consists of the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Authentication Service**: Verifies user identity and generates secure tokens
2. **Score Processing Service**: Validates and processes score update requests
3. **Leaderboard Manager**: Maintains and retrieves the current leaderboard state
4. **Real-time Update Service**: Broadcasts score changes to connected clients

### Data Models

#### User
```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "username": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "lastActive": "timestamp"
}
```

#### Score
```json
{
  "userId": "string (UUID)",
  "score": "number",
  "lastUpdated": "timestamp"
}
```

#### Action
```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "userId": "string (UUID)",
  "type": "string",
  "timestamp": "timestamp",
  "scoreValue": "number",
  "metadata": "object (action-specific data)"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

#### `POST /api/auth/login`
Authenticates a user and issues access token

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "token": "string (JWT)",
  "expiresIn": "number (seconds)"
}
```

### Score Management

#### `POST /api/scores/update`
Records a completed action and updates the user's score

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer {token}`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "actionType": "string",
  "actionMetadata": "object (optional)",
  "timestamp": "number (epoch ms)"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": "boolean",
  "newScore": "number",
  "leaderboardPosition": "number (optional)"
}
```

#### `GET /api/leaderboard`
Retrieves the current top 10 users and their scores

**Response:**
```json
{
  "updatedAt": "timestamp",
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "username": "string",
      "score": "number",
      "position": "number"
    }
    // ... up to 10 entries
  ]
}
```

### WebSocket API

#### `WS /api/live/leaderboard`
Establishes a WebSocket connection for real-time leaderboard updates

**Authentication:**
- Connection query parameter: `?token={jwt}`

**Events:**

1. `leaderboard_update`: Sent when the leaderboard changes
```json
{
  "type": "leaderboard_update",
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "userId": "string",
      "username": "string",
      "score": "number",
      "position": "number"
    }
    // ... up to 10 entries
  ]
}
```

2. `score_update`: Sent when a user's score changes
```json
{
  "type": "score_update",
  "userId": "string",
  "username": "string", 
  "newScore": "number",
  "change": "number",
  "newPosition": "number (optional)"
}
```

## Security Measures

### 1. Action Verification

Each action that increases a user's score must be validated through the following process:

1. **Authentication**: Verify the user's JWT token
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit the frequency of score-increasing actions per user
3. **Action Validation**: Verify the action is legitimate through application logic
4. **Tamper Prevention**: Use signed action records to prevent client-side manipulation

### 2. Score Integrity Protection

To prevent unauthorized score changes:

1. **Server-side Calculation**: All score calculations happen on the server, not client
2. **Idempotent Processing**: Actions with the same ID are processed only once
3. **Audit Trail**: Keep a record of all score-changing actions for each user
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual patterns of score increases

### 3. API Security

1. **JWT Authentication**: Use short-lived JWT tokens with appropriate scopes
2. **HTTPS**: All API endpoints must use HTTPS
3. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for non-GET requests
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all input parameters against expected formats

## Implementation Flow

1. User performs an action in the frontend application
2. Frontend sends an authenticated API request to the Score Processing Service
3. Score Processing Service:
   - Validates the JWT token
   - Verifies the action is legitimate
   - Calculates the new score
   - Updates the score in the database
   - Triggers an event to the Leaderboard Manager
4. Leaderboard Manager:
   - Updates the cached leaderboard if needed
   - Sends update to the Real-time Update Service
5. Real-time Update Service:
   - Broadcasts updates to all connected clients via WebSockets

## Data Storage

### Primary Data Store

A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store:
- User accounts
- Permanent score records
- Action history
- Authentication logs

### Caching Layer

Redis for:
- Current leaderboard (sorted set)
- Rate limiting counters
- Session information
- Action deduplication

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching**: Cache the leaderboard to avoid database queries on each view
2. **Sharding**: Shard user scores by user ID ranges if the user base is large
3. **Batching**: Batch score updates during high-traffic periods
4. **Background Processing**: Move non-critical operations to background jobs
5. **Read Replicas**: Use database read replicas for leaderboard queries

## Deployment Architecture

The module should be deployed as a set of microservices:

1. **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and token generation
2. **Score Service**: Processes and validates score updates
3. **Leaderboard Service**: Manages the leaderboard state and queries
4. **WebSocket Service**: Handles real-time client connections and updates

## Monitoring and Logging

The following metrics should be tracked:

1. **Score update latency**: Time to process a score update
2. **Leaderboard refresh latency**: Time to recalculate the leaderboard
3. **Rejected actions**: Count of rejected score update attempts
4. **WebSocket message latency**: Time from score update to client notification
5. **Active WebSocket connections**: Number of current leaderboard subscribers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Leaderboard Categories**: Support multiple leaderboards by category/game type
2. **Time-based Leaderboards**: Daily, weekly, and all-time leaderboards
3. **Friend Leaderboards**: Personalized leaderboards showing just friends
4. **Achievement System**: Award badges for reaching score milestones
5. **Anti-cheat Analysis**: Machine learning to detect abnormal scoring patterns

## Development Considerations

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests, including load tests
2. **Documentation**: API documentation with examples for frontend integration
3. **Development Environment**: Mock services for local development
4. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout of enhancements
